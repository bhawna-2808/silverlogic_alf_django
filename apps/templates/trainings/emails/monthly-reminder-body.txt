Hello,

We’re thrilled you’re using ALF Boss!

In order to make the most of our Training module, remember to update employee status regularly.

Those employees who are not currently working in your facility can be changed to ‘inactive’ status. New employees should be added upon hire or on a regular basis. This will ensure that your employee Dashboard shows all the trainings and tasks due, and ensures you remain in compliance.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out by email or using the chat widget.

Thank you,

ALF Boss
